- 👋 Howdy, I’m @infosecmatt
- 👀 I’m a cybersecurity professional that is interested in offensive security, security program implementation, vulnerability management, and secure development.
- 🌱 I’m always focused on learning more and going deeper down the technical security rabbit hole... Over the past year, I've mostly been honing and refining my skills in pentesting, scripting, and cloud security.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source security tools and projects.
- 📫 You can reach me by emailing me@infosecmatt.com or by sending me a message on LinkedIn.
